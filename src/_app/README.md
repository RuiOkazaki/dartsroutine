# App

All kinds of app-wide matters, both in the technical sense (e.g., context providers) and in the business sense (e.g., analytics).
This layer usually doesn't contain slices, like Shared, instead having segments directly.

## Example

- Styles
- Routing
- Store and other context providers
- Analytics initialization
